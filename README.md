# Playground for Classical Applications
Personal playground for the postgraduate seminar for CSE in computational physics @ ETH ZÃ¼rich.
Treating the paper `Investigating the use of field solvers for simulating classical systems` about quantum solvers applied to classical systems.

# Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Optional: Initialize your venv with the following code:  
    `$ python3 -m venv venv`  
    Then activate your environment:  
    `$ source venv/bin/active`  

3. Install requirements
	```bash
	pip install --upgrade pip
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
